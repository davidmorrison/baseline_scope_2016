\subsection{Reduced EMCal $\eta$ coverage}
\label{sec:reduced-emcal-eta}

\textbf{Cost delta: -\$2.1M ($2\times 2$ ganged towers); -\$2M
  (reduced segmentation towers)}

The pseudorapidity coverage of the EMCal can be reduced to find cost
savings. This can be done relavitve to the EMCal design in the pCDR, a
scenario in which EMCal towers are read out in $2\times 2$ groupings,
or in a scenario in which the EMCal granularity is reduced.
