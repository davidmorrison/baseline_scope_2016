\section{Summary}

In this document the sPHENIX collaboration has answered a charge~(see
Appendix~\ref{charge}) from BNL ALD Berndt Mueller to develop
a baseline design scope that provides a compelling physics program
within the constraints of possible DOE funding redirected from
RHIC operations. The document describes a reference design based
on the calorimeter configuration in the sPHENIX pTDR and a tracking system
combining a 3-layer MAPS inner tracker and a TPC outer tracker. We
demonstrate the performance of the reference configuration for a
a compelling physics program focused on three science drivers: jet structure,
heavy-flavor jet production and $\Upsilon$ spectroscopy.
We have provided a comprehensive list of re-scoping options for each
of the main subdetector systems. For each change we have 
described the associated
cost savings, the engineering and schedule impact and impact on
key performance measures related to the three science
drivers. Based on these criteria, we have developed a
rank-ordered list of re-scoping options, including the
cumulative cost-savings and science impact, to allow determination
of an optimal balance of cost savings and science performance.
