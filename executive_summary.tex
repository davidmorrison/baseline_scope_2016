In this document the sPHENIX collaboration answers a charge~(see
Appendix~\ref{charge}) from BNL ALD Berndt Mueller to develop
a baseline design scope that provides a compelling physics program
within the constraints of possible DOE funding redirected from 
RHIC operations. The document describes a reference design based
on the calorimeter configuration in the sPHENIX pCDR and a tracking system
combining a 3-layer MAPS inner tracker and a TPC outer tracker. We
demonstrate the performance of the reference configuration for a
a compelling physics program focused on three science drivers: jet structure,
heavy-flavor jet production and $\Upsilon$ spectroscopy. 
We then provide a comprehensive list of re-scoping options for each
of the main subdetector systems. For each change we describe the associated
cost savings, the engineering and schedule impact 
based on estimates by project leadership in consultation with the 
engineering team and subsystem experts
at the level of detail achievable in the time allowed. 
The physics impact of each re-scoping option is studied for a focussed set of performance criteria
related to the three science drivers, using simulations ranging from
generator level studies to full detector simulations. Based on the 
current status of these studies, we develop a 
rank-ordered list of re-scoping options, including the 
cumulative cost-savings and science impact, to allow determination
of an optimal balance of cost savings and science performance.

  \caption{Cost reduction scenarios identified by the scientific
    collaboration in consultation with the project that
    signficantly reduce the M\&S costs while preserving a 
    compelling science program.  Both scenarios involve very serious
    cuts to detectors and represent very unfortunate degradations in
    capability. Both scenarios have significantly worsened $e/\pi$
    separation, acceptance for $\Upsilon$s and photons, and suffer a
    longer time before reconstructed data would be available.  Both
    scenarios identify a path to restore capabilities should
    additional funding be identified.  The scenario on the left retains
    the ability to identify displaced tracks, preserving HF-tagged
    jet capability. The scenario on the right sacrifices even this key
    physics capability.    
    Costs are in \$M.}
