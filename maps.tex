We have investigated the positive impact on the sPHENIX science case
of a highly performant inner tracker providing HF-tagged jet
capability, confirmatory support for the TPC outer tracker in a
high-rate high-multiplicity environment, and information to reject low
$p_T$ decays falsely reconstructed as higher $p_T$ tracks.  Precision
tracking is fundamental to the whole sPHENIX science program, to such
a degree that there is a strong consensus in the collaboration to
prioritize tracking highly, even if it means making difficult, though
reasonable, compromises to the calorimeters.

The leading strategy for building an inner tracker for sPHENIX is to
base it on the development being done for the MAPS-based ALICE inner
tracker.  Compared to reuse of the PHENIX VTX pixels, such a detector
would have greater pointing precision, extending to lower $p_T$ the
usable DCA capability, have a much higher fraction of live pixels, and
because the ALICE MAPS staves are 27~cm long (compared to 20~cm for
the PHENIX VTX staves), greater acceptance for the luminosity
delivered by RHIC.
