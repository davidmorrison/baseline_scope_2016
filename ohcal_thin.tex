\section*{Thinned Outer HCal}
\label{ohcal_thin}

\textbf{Cost delta: -\$0.4M}

We investigated reducing the thickness of the outer HCal by 20~cm, or
approxiately one nuclear interaction length.  The thickness of the
outer HCal in the pCDR design is 86.5~cm.  Several possible effects
were investigated through full \geant simulations of the calorimeter
response.  It should be noted that the calorimeter simulations have
recently been compared to data from the FNAL test beam and have been
found to reproduce the measured response quite well.  We looked at the
effect of thinning on the jet energy response, high-$z$ fragmentation
functions.

From a physics perspective, the effect of thinning the outer HCal by
this amount seems to be moderate, and considered by itself, a thinner
outer HCal would still enable the core elements of the sphenix physics
program to be carried out.

From the perspective of the project, the effect of this modification
would be extremely significant.  The outer HCal is the structural
backbone of the sPHENIX structure.  Reducing the radial thickness
significantly reduces the ability of the outer HCal to support the
detector.  The finite element analysis would need to be redone, and
the tilt angle of the steel plates reanalyzed and likely changed. The
prototyping and test beam would have to be redone, delaying plans to
build a full scale mechanical prototype.  The inner HCal will need
some redesign due to the changes in the EMCal, as the $\phi$
segmentation of the two calorimeters should match for mechanical
reasons.  This option sets the outer HCal engineering back as much as
twelve months and requires R\&D be redone.

In the nominal design, the $5.5 \lambda$ total depth of the
calorimeter stack (at $\eta = 0$) is distributed as $1 \lambda$
(EMCal), $1 \lambda$ (inner HCal), and $3.5 \lambda$.  If the outer
HCal is reduced to $2.5 \lambda$, one has to consider the effects if
one or more of the other calorimeters in the stack is also modified.
If the inner HCal is not installed, the depth of the calorimeter stack
is reduced by an additional $1 \lambda$ over the whole acceptance,
falling to $2.5 \lambda$ at midrapidity.  If the EMCal acceptance is
cut to $|\eta| < 0.7$, the thickness of the calorimeter stack in the
range $0.7 < \eta < 1.1$ becomes thinner by $1 \lambda$, but the
effect in that range (aside from the lack of EMCal coverage) is
moderated by the increasing thickness of the calorimeters along lines
of constant $\eta$ due to their rectangular profile.
