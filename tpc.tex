\textbf{Cost delta: -\$0.5M}

We have considered the effect of instrumenting only alternate rows of
the TPC readout plane, reducing the cost of the electronics by
approximately a factor of two.


\subsection*{Considerations}

A number of people in the collaboration have expressed a very strong
interest in maintaining the potential for $\pi$, $K$, $p$ particle
identification through a $dE/dx$ measurement in the TPC.  While we may
already be driven to set the voltages on the TPC GEMs in a way that
minimizes ion backflow at the expense of worsened $dE/dx$ resolution,
the additional worsening that comes from not reading out half the pad
rows will be taken as a very negative statement about their physics
interests.
