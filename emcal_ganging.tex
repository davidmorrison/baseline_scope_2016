\section{EMCal}

The EMCal accounts for a significant portion of the M\&S budget.  It
also enables the key $\Upsilon$ and direct $\gamma$ and $\gamma+$jet
capabilities of sPHENIX.  

\subsection{EMCal Ganged Towers}
\label{emcal_ganging}

\textbf{Cost delta: -\$1.7M}

We have studied the effect of ganging together the electronic outputs
of groupings of four nominally-sized EMCal towers.  This has several
effects of this modification are a reduction in the $e/\pi$ separation
performance in Au$+$Au collisions.  This results in towers that are
effectively $\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi = 0.048\times0.048$,
substantially coarser granularity than the pCDR design.  It also
results in a significant ``mortgage'' --- a loss of capability that
the collaboration is strongly motivated to buy back as funds permit.
