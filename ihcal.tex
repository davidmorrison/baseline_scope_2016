\subsection{Inner HCal}
\label{ihcal}

We have considered not building and installing the inner HCal.  The
inner HCal has three important functions in sPHENIX.  It provides an
interaction length of active detector near the shower maximum of a
hadron shower, serves as a tail-catcher for EM shower energy leaking
out of the back of the EMCal and is the structural support for the
EMCal.  The structural support function is straightforward to replace
with approximately three months of engineering work and roughly \$100k
in M\&S costs.  Without the inner HCal, the EM-shower tail-catching
function would have to be provided by the outer HCal.  However, due to
the distance and the amount of inactive material between the EMCal and
outer HCal, the outer HCal performs poorly as a tail-catcher.  Finally
with no inner HCal, a hadron that starts showering in the EMCal would
emerge into an air gap containing a 1.5~T field followed by the magnet
plus cryostat and then the outer HCal.  The shower would be distorted
in a way that must be better understood before we can quantify its
effect on the energy resolution, jet identification or the ability to
subtract the underlying event.  For these reasons, the colaboration
very strongly disfavors removing the inner HCal.
