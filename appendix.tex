\label{cha:performance-plots}

To keep the discussion of options in the preceedings pages as brief as
possible, we collect here the performance plots detailing the effects
of various changes to a reference design.

  \caption{EMCal coverage VS tower counts. With half tower produced to cover from central pseudo-rapidity, 2D SPACAL cover to an eta of 0.55 (quite linear in eta coverage) and 1D SPACAL cover to eta of 0.63 (forward tower has less eta-bite) at its outer radius and 0.70 at its inner radius (clip into forward acceptance). Nevertheless, EM shower coverage to |eta|<=0.6 is a good approximation.}

  \caption{ Ratios of inclusive charged hadron rejection of $2\times2$ ganged
 EMCal to the reference design, as functions of electron ID
 efficiency. This is evaluated for negatively charged tracks of three
 choices of momentum and for middle and edge rapidity in 10% most
 central Au+Au events.}
